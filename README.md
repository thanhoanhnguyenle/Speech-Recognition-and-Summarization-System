# Speech-Recognition-and-Summarization-System
*This is a guided project from Dataquest*

In this project, I'm going to build a speech recognition and summarization system that can be used for automatically transcribing audio files, such as lecture notes, podcasts, or videos, and turning them into a short summary. The project is run in local machine, using Windows Linux Subsystem. Here is the steps involved: 

## Install
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the Speech-Recognition-and-Summarization-System folder:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thanhoanhnguyenle/Speech-Recognition-and-Summarization-System.git
   cd Speech-Recognition-and-Summarization-System
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   The project require Python with version 3.8+.
   ```
   virtualenv speech-recognition
   source speech*/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install package:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
